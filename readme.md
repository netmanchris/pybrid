# Python Wrapper for Atellani Brid Air Purifier

This project is a alpha wrapper for the Atellani Brid Air Purifier.

note: This library was created by reverse engineering the Brid iOS application API calls
using the wonderful application Charles Proxy. 

This library may break at any time as Brid has not publically documented the API or made
any warranty as to it's use outside of their application. Be warned.
